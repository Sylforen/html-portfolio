<h1>The Best Movies According to Austin</h1>
<h2>Some of my favourite movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
    <h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
    <p>Masterpiece. The Hobbit didn't need three films.</p>
    <h3>Deadpool</h3>
    <p>Insanity from start to finish. The sequel didn't really expand upon the formula.</p>
    <h3>The Green Mile</h3>
    <p>Beautiful. For when you need to cry.</p>
    <h3>Studio Ghibli</h3>
    <p>Shout outs in particular to Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, and Totoro.</p>
</ul>
